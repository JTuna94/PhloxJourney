Phlox Journey is a Java game made using SimpleGraphicsGFX library (by <CodeforAll_>).

A project we made that is influenced by the heavily popularized game Flappy Bird.
In this case we follow Phlox, our lone protagonist.
While Phlox traverses the silent and mysterious bamboo forest, our hopeless little warrior must master the art of flight to overcome the terrible quest that is set upon him.
